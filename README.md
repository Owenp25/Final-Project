# Predicting-Heart-Disease-and-Chest-Pain-Type-Project
Final Project completed in a group by me, Atticus Patrick, and Cameron Lunn. This was a collaborative effort where we split up the work equally between the three of us. We used R to analyze a public heart disease data set from kaggle where each row is an individual patient. Our aim was to look into the key factors that determine heart disease and predict the occurrence of heart disease in individuals based on a number of heart-health related predictor variables. A secondary goal was to look at chest pain type and to try and predict this in patients as well. The data used in this study consists of 5 independent sub-datasets of heart health related data. The main response variables looked at in the study were heart disease status and chest pain type. We found that the data are well suited to make predictions for heart disease status when using a decision tree. Additionally, we discovered that predicting chest pain type was very difficult and could not fit an accurate model using KNN, QDA, or a decision tree.
